##Abstract
While the phenomena of large increases in gun sales following changes in aggregate demand
factors are well documented, similar conclusions about the behavior of the ammunition market in
response to such alterations remain undetermined. The domestic ammunition market has received
comparatively little analysis relative to other types of comparable commodities in terms of economic
and public policy research. This study seeks to contribute to this literature by analyzing
the responsiveness of ammunition prices to changes in the producer price index of its constitutive
elements, and to establish a general overview of the domestic ammunition market as a whole. This
analysis presents 3 key findings. First, 7 out of 119 firearm calibers sold account for over half of all
ammunition sales. Second, there are unexpected differences in price elasticity of demand between
these 7 common calibers. Third, changes in the real price per cartridge of commonly available
brass cased, full metal jacket calibers do not increase or decrease commensurately to changes in
the producer price indexes of input elements brass, copper, and lead. These results suggest that the
primary determinant of changes in the real price per round of ammunition originate in aggregate
demand, rather than from producers passing along increases in production costs.
